# ML_Project7_ANN
The purpose of this project is to perform classification on the Digits dataset using an ANN model.
Project workflow:

1. load the Digits dataset
2. preprocess the dataset:
    * normalised pixel values
    * split the data into train/val/test subsets
3. used an ANN to classify the dataset - the initial model has a single hidden layer
    * trained and evaluate the model on the Digits dataset
    * created additional ANNs by modifying the hyperparameters of the model to obtain the best performance
4. trained and evaluated these models on the Digits dataset
5. compared the results of the experiments that you have conducted and explained the findings
